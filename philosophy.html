<h2>Philosophy</h2>

<div class="prose" id="philosophy">
    <p>We believe that, thanks to the <a href="http://wiki.bitshares.org/index.php/DPOS">delegated proof-of-stake</a> mechanism,
    a BitShares <a href="http://wiki.bitshares.org/index.php/Distributed_Autonomous_Company">DAC</a>
    has an extremely important
    advantage not often mentioned when compared to other crypto-currencies
    experiments, which is that it is <b><em>able to choose its personality</em></b>.</p>

    <h4>- A MISSION -</h4>

    <p>We believe that delegates should have a purpose, a mission.

    Running a stable delegate node is a
    noble purpose, but one of limited ambition. Delegates should offer more to the
    network than just running a stable node, they have the chance of being part of
    a few elected in order to ensure the entire DAC runs smoothly.
    If the pay they get in return is sufficient, these delegates
    can, and should spend it on advancing the network on a specific concept or idea.
    Delegates can do core development, web development, marketing, community
    management, etc. but should strive to provide an added value to the BitShares
    network, and should be voted in or out depending on what specific traits
    of personality the shareholders want to give to their DAC.
    <br><br>
    This is like having bonus points that you can use to boost certain
    characteristics of the DAC you have invested in, because you believe that the
    network would be better off by furthering development on these issues.
    </p>

    <h4>- POSSIBILITIES -</h4>

    <p>This could allow a BitShares DAC to have more delegates
    oriented towards core development and network infrastructure, while BitShares
    Music delegates could focus on marketing and funding for events at big concerts,
    etc...
    The possibilities are infinite,
    and it behooves the potential delegates to convince the shareholders that
    the value they can bring to the network is higher than the pay they get for
    doing it.</p>

    <p>&hellip;and thus it became known to all living creatures on this planet that
    each of them was part of a whole, and that the common energy
    that was flowing through them and animating them all had a sentience of its
    own, and that it was called Gaia.</p>
    <p>Gaia was everywhere, in the mountains and the oceans, in the earth and
    the wind, but there was a special forest somewhere, at the heart of which
    lay a hundred and one trees which were called the Council of the Wise, and which were as
    many facets of Gaia's personality.</p>
    <p>Their role was to channel the energy of all life on the planet in order
    to magnify and amplify it, and redistribute it to sustain growth and balance
    of the entire ecosystem, to ultimately make Gaia a stronger and more connected
    place.</p>
