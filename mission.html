<h2>Mission</h2>

<div id="mission-section1">
    <p>Our mission is to improve and enhance the strength of the network in
    order to make it more resilient to both accidental failures and directed
    attacks. The network can only grow&mdash;and thus appreciate in value&mdash;if
    new users are joining it, and those users will only come if they trust
    the system. Ultimately, we believe that the BitSharesX platform can turn
    not only into a robust system, but also into an
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility">antifragile</a> one.
    This can only be achieved if the system is able to withstand software anomalies
    easily enough to let the economic experiments be run in a smooth manner.</p>

    <h4>- DELEGATES -</h4>
    <p>
        To fulfill this mission, we propose 2 delegate bids, which can be seen on the
        <a href="/index.html">home page</a>. Collected fees will be used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>first, pay for the hosting of the delegates and backup nodes on
            a good quality VPS. No cheap thing, this needs to run well and
            quality has a price.</li>

            <li>then, the remaining funds will be used to fulfill each delegate's
            designated mission</li>
        </ul>
    <br>

    <h4>- A HEALTHY ECOSYSTEM -</h4>
    <p>
        Ultimately, the question that every
        shareholder should consider is the following:<br>
        <i>&ldquo;Would you rather gain a small interest per year on your BTS, or would
        you rather see an army of independent delegates all devoting their energy on making
        sure that the network becomes even better than it already is, and potentially
        make the overall system grow more than the interest you would have had?&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        The fact that the delegate pay can be quite high coupled with the fact that
        delegates can be voted in and out very easily and instantly
        from the wallet interface means the selection of delegates remains always
        competitive, and thus ensures good health of the ecosystem
        surrounding the DAC.
