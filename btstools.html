    <b><em>Make it as easy as possible to run and monitor a delegate efficiently</em></b><br>
    <span class="light">and</span><br>
    <b><em>Quickly react in case of error/failure</em></b>
</div>

<p>The mission for this delegate is to fund the development of monitoring tools for running
the bitshares delegate client and sending notifications in case something goes
wrong with it.</p>

<p>It is important for security to try to have the most stable, bug-free code, but
crashes, errors and adverse events always happen, so it only makes sense to also
have powerful monitoring tools in order to rapidly react to conditions endangering
the general health of the network.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
    <p>The tools cover, or plan to cover, the following areas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>[DONE] one-liner tools to properly build a given version of the client and run it</li>
        <li>[DONE] client monitoring of CPU, RAM, connections</li>
        <li>[DONE] overview of multiple instances running on different nodes to ensure
            a smooth transition when compiling main node / running on a backup node</li>
        <li>[DONE] email notifications and iOS push notifications when node goes offline or misses a block</li>
        <li>[DONE] automatic checking and publishing of feeds for BTC, gold, silver and all fiat BitAssets</li>
        <li>[TODO] anti-DDoS tools / proxies for hiding delegates</li>
    </ul>
